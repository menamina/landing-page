I started this HTML/CSS + flexbox journey with the odin project on 7.15.25
today is 7.23.25. flexbox has been the hardest thing to learn, today is my second full day with it.
i feel like there could be more efficient ways of doing what ive been doing ofc.
im hoping through more practice things will become more intuitive.

im excited to implement my own style to these projects while trying to learn and understand how the containers work.

i made a filler site about the moon and it's phases to not only practice layout but also give me something that i am excited to work on.

i want to also make the titles of these repos better and commit better.
